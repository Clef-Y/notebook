###Compress an Entire Directory or a Single File

	__tar -czvf name-of-archive.tar.gz /path/to/directory-or-file__

Here’s what those switches actually mean:

	-c: Create an archive.
	-z: Compress the archive with gzip.
	-v: Display progress in the terminal while creating the archive, also known as “verbose” mode. The v is always optional in these commands, but it’s helpful.
	-f: Allows you to specify the filename of the archive.

###Compress Multiple Directories or Files at Once

	__tar -czvf archive.tar.gz /home/ubuntu/Downloads /usr/local/stuff /home/ubuntu/Documents/notes.txt__


###Exclude Directories and Files

	__tar -czvf archive.tar.gz /home/ubuntu --exclude=/home/ubuntu/Downloads --exclude=/home/ubuntu/.cache__

	__tar -czvf archive.tar.gz /home/ubuntu --exclude=*.mp4__

###Use bzip2 Compression Instead

Gzip is faster, but it generally compresses a bit less, so you get a somewhat larger file. Bzip2 is slower, but it compresses a bit more, so you get a somewhat smaller file.

	__tar -cjvf archive.tar.bz2 stuff__

###Extract an Archive

You may want to extract the contents of the archive to a specific directory. You can do so by appending the -C switch to the end of the command.

	__tar -xzvf archive.tar.gz -C /tmp__
	
If the file is a bzip2-compressed file, replace the “z” in the above commands with a “j”.
